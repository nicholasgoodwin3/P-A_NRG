I am a avid world of warcraft player and would like to create a site and app to store talent builds that a player can use 

New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: I want to learn how to use file upload for things like images as well as using bootstrap CSS elements more indepth.

Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2) : basic front end (layout,all pages present) and operational back end (routing,database is operating as intended)

Week 2 Features (to show at the first office hour/lecture of Week 3) : Finishing up backend problems, setting up CSS and bootstrap, fixing coding errors present.

Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...) :}

Would like to try and find a way to actively embed a fully graphical talent tree on the site, allowing a user to build a talent tree.
